    """You create a song object and a serializer, and you convert the song to its string representation by using the .serialize() method.
     The method takes the song object as a parameter, as well as a string value representing the format you want.
     The last call uses YAML as the format, which is not supported by the serializer, so a ValueError exception is raised.

This example is short and simplified, but it still has a lot of complexity.
There are three logical or execution paths depending on the value of the format parameter.
This may not seem like a big deal, and youâ€™ve probably seen code with more complexity than this,
 but the above example is still pretty hard to maintain."""
